# Erisa's script that runs when a GitHub Codespace is created

Right now this basically just installs some common utilities I might use. Maybe later it might do more.

See: https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles

I am not a person that uses dotfiles on machines, everything here is in [install.sh](install.sh) which you can visit to see what I'm running for my codespaces.
